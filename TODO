=== TODO
- when coding basic blocks, if a successor is containered, emit a goto
  instead of coding it (it will be coded in its advanced block, and it
  will probably look nicer; see random_funkyloop.bin)

=== OPTIONAL
- export graphs to graphviz:
  - block graph for finding additional structures	DONE
  - insn/statement graphs for verifying correctness
- graphing: make entry point a different shape
- don't use ssa.fun_args_d directly, implement methods
- fun_0x8082: a8 is made explicit because fun_0x8edd() clobbers a, but we
  ignore it, so we don't actually need the copy
- copy single-insn blocks (label_81c5, for instance) instead of emitting
  a goto
- structure shortcut ITE conditions such as label_90dc

=== LATER
- detect volatile locations like in BCity:fun_d8f6
- casting an uint8_t to a pointer is semi-bogus
- operator precedence for type cast
- unconditional loop at SMB:label_811b
- f580: why is there a double arrow in advsequencef52c?

=== DONE

- don't DCE memory writes	DONE
- don't DCE MMIO	DONE
- implement default defs/uses for calls (defines all, uses all)	WONTFIX
  - implement method to get all definitions	DONE
  - allow more than one def per statement	DONE
  - doesn't work: what is 'defines all' supposed to mean?	EXACTLY!
  - find defs/returns instead (recursive on call op)	DONE
- implement phi functions	DONE
- implement propagation		DONE
- implement proper reaching defs (current definitions include regs with
  wrong indices, which is fine for returns, but hampers DCE)	DONE
- pretty-print phi functions	DONE
- implement expression simplification	DONE
- fix tail call (see 0x8e2d in SMB1) <- that is not a tail call; anyway:
  DONE (hopefully)
- implement limited CSE (typical case: A(n) := A(m) - 1; bcc A(m) - 1)
  for prettiness and to avoid unnecessary temps	DONE
- speed up dephiing	DONE
- speed up DCE	DONE (somewhat...)
- eliminate duplicates when redefining returns	DONE (I think)
- clip SSA trees when encountering conditional branches that are actually
  unconditional after propagation	DONE
- determine true returns	DONE (I hope)
- propagate into ssadefs (first attempt failed miserably)	OBSOLETE
  (did away with complex definitions)
- make ssa statement next/comefrom lists!!! (undeterministic branching is
  BAD!!)	DONE
- find if/thens that have a dead end (return)	DONE
- 81c6: why is the left sequence not extended by another block?	DONE
  (iterative structuring)
- 8004: why are bblocks ending in branches in a sequence?	WONTFIX
  (they are single-block loops)
- 8edd: loop in a sequence?	DONE (graphing error)
- f41b:		DONE (I think, thanks to iterative structuring)
  - if/then/else at f48d not recognized
  - if/then at f4c2 not recognized
- code branches explicitly, not at a bblock end (cf. bblock bas81A9)	DONE
  (I think, I don't see anything relevant in bas81A9, but branches are now
  coded explicitly)
- waitaminit: how can you translate back from SSA by omitting the index if
  you have stuff like "A(26) := x" followed by "bcc (A(25))" or somesuch???
  PROBABLYDONE (introduced copying and explicit phi functions where
  necessary)
- DEREF is inconsistently used, making coding difficult; use separate
  LOAD and STORE expressions	DONE
- wrong tmp1 usage in fun_0x80c3 (used before assignment)	DONE
  (end bblock when encountering statements already processed)
- code proper function headers (no whatever and something)	DONE
- order function parameters (there is no implied ordering due to lack of a
  calling convention in the machine code; it's probably best done in the
  code generator)	DONE (in ssa, necessary to map call parameters
  to function arguments)
- don't code memory function parameters (as C parameters)	DONE
- out-of-scope tmp0 in fun_0x8e6a	DONE
- return identification may cause dead code to be eliminated, which in turn
  may cause input parameters to change; need to revisit args and all calls
  to the function; see IDENTIRET 1037	WORKAROUND (we had to ignore returns
  that don't have a dessa_name because of this, and that seems to do the job
  just fine for now)
- implement barriers (SEI/CLI, for instance, gets DCEd ATM) <- do it
  as an impure statement and introduce an intrinsic expression	DONE
- do condition negation when coding IT(E)	DONE (only IT, the other
  one is already done by ordering the blocks accordingly)
- pretested loop (example: f7c5 in f694) (tricky: the loop header is more
  than just a branch, it does other things, too, and that's not how a
  for(;;) loop in C works; it could be done as a while() loop with comma
  operator, but I'm not sure if that is really useful...)	DONE
- inconsistent return types for fun_0xf3a9	DONE
- declare local (register) variables	DONE
- declare memory variables as extern	DONE
- implement one-shot comments for demo purposes DONE
- translate indirect jump to something other than an endless loop so it can
  be properly commented on	DONE
- implement expression coding	DONE
- dessa bug: if an old value does not reach the bblock to begin with, it is
  pointless to copy it; see 0xf377	DONE
- don't (re)declare function arguments	DONE
- why does fun_0xf8f4 have three identical parameters?	INVALID (seems to
  have fixed itself, and I cannot find a commit in which it is broken)
- structure post loop bas8018/bas801f	DONE
- make the debug output optional	DONE
- declare arrays	DONE
- code: clean up duplicate code that checks if code or a goto should be
  emitted	DONE
- simplify '1 >> 1' (bas8e5e)	DONE
- comment deficiencies verbosely:	DONE
  - rotate		DONE
  - IOity of indirect accesses	DONE
  - indirect jumps	DONE
  - array sizes		DONE
  - zero-page globals	DONE
- comment the recursion shortcut	DONE
- modifies/modified comments should be shortened if too long	DONE
- stack at 0 or below should not reach (e.g. BCity start_d400)	DONE
- simplify constant comparisions (14 != 8 in SMB)	DONE
- don't declare memory that is implicitly used by calls (BCity:fun_c41d)
  DONE
- BCity:fun_e409 has undeclared array	DONE
- looks like wrong propagation in rotate in Bcity:fun_d689	INVALID
  (nope, that's reading the controller shift register)
- uses/modifies comments are distracting, only put them at function
  definitions	DONE (relegated to debug level 2)
- comment on symbolic I/O addresses	DONE (added to general MMIO comment)
- RAW in BCity:fun_d9be	DONE
- RAW in BCity:fun_c5b0	DONE
- advifthenF349: eliminate if(1)	DONE (actually was an if(0))
- fun_0xf3a9 has extraneous return (n) which isn't used anywhere	DONE
  (probably fixed in b1a711b)
- don't declare locals that are defined by a function call, but not used or
  returned	DONE (7642846)
- implement remaining opcodes:	DONE!!!
